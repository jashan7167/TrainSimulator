# Train Simulation
This is a real-time train simulation system developed using Python programming language, Tkinter GUI toolkit, SimPy and TkinterMapView. The system simulates the movement of a train from one station to another, considering different factors such as acceleration, retardation, and waiting time at each station.

## Features
- Select a train from the available options
- Select the weather condition (sunny or rainy)
- Set the acceleration and retardation values of the train
- Set the waiting time at each station
- Simulate the movement of the train and view the intermediate stations
## Technologies Used
- Python programming language
- Tkinter GUI toolkit
- SimPy for realtime simulation
- <a href = "https://github.com/TomSchimansky/TkinterMapView" target = "_blank"> TkinterMapView </a> for displaying map
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for displaying images
## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the root directory of the project
- Install the required dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the `gui.py` file to start the system
